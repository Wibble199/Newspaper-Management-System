### Notes
- There are two SQL directories:
	- `./sql` directory is for SQL backups and supporting queries (such as the DB structure or sample data).
	- `./app/sql` directory is for SQL that will be dynamically be loaded into the NodeJS server, for example if the code is deemed too large to be embedded in the JS file.
